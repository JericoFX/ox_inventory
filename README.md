## üìå A Note on Community

> _A real open-source community thrives on transparency, inclusion, and mutual respect ‚Äî not on intimidation or control._

This fork is maintained with full respect for the spirit and principles of open source. I deeply appreciate the foundational work by Overextended ‚Äî all credit goes to them. However, it's important to be clear: **open-source software is not a tool for personal power, gatekeeping, or hostility**. It belongs to everyone who respects its license and contributes in good faith.

The **GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)** allows anyone to use, modify, and redistribute software ‚Äî even commercially ‚Äî as long as the same license is preserved and the original authors are credited. This license exists to promote **freedom and collaboration**, not exclusion or ownership over ideas once they're published.

Toxic behavior, cliques, or fear-based moderation are antithetical to what open source stands for. I do not support or endorse any group or individual who uses community spaces to enforce such dynamics.

Some may ask why this project isn't based directly on the original repositories. The answer is straightforward: this fork extends support and improvements for **QBCore**. I believe every developer deserves access to robust tools and respectful collaboration, no matter their choice of framework.

This project is for builders, learners, and collaborators ‚Äî for anyone who wants to create something better, together.

#### **Network Optimization**

The dynamic inventory system has been optimized with clean network ID handling:

- **Smart freeze behavior** - Objects are frozen client-side when they don't use network synchronization to prevent movement exploits
- **Network-based persistence** - Objects with network ID are inherently persistent and don't require freezing
- **Clear separation** - `useNetwork` affects both inventory ID format and object persistence behavior
- **Better performance** - Eliminated unnecessary network checks and duplicate validations

#### **Registration Process**

The dynamic inventory system is **fully runtime** - no server restart required:

```lua
-- Register a new inventory type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:RegisterInventoryType({
    name = 'lockers',
    models = { 1234567890, 9876543210 },
    interaction = {
        distance = 2.0,
        icon = 'fas fa-box',
        label = 'Open Locker'
    },
    behavior = {
        useNetwork = true  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è See performance warning below
    },
    slots = 10,
    maxWeight = 50000,
    items = {
        maxItems = 3,  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep low with useNetwork=true
        items = {
            { name = 'water', min = 1, max = 2, chance = 60 },
            { name = 'bandage', min = 1, max = 1, chance = 30 },
            { name = 'money', min = 10, max = 100, chance = 15 }
        }
    },
    validation = {
        groups = { ['police'] = 0 }  -- Optional group restrictions
    }
})
```

#### **Performance Warning**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Synchronization Alert**: When using `useNetwork = true` with `maxItems > 10`, you'll receive a warning:

```
[ox_inventory] [WARN] Inventory type "lockers" uses network synchronization with 15 max items. 
High item counts may cause network synchronization issues. Consider reducing maxItems or setting useNetwork to false.
```

**Best Practices:**
- `useNetwork = true` + `maxItems ‚â§ 10` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Good performance
- `useNetwork = false` + `maxItems > 10` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Good performance  
- `useNetwork = true` + `maxItems > 10` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause network lag

#### **Available Exports**

All operations are **runtime** - no server restart required:

```lua
-- Unregister an inventory type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:UnregisterInventoryType('lockers')

-- Get specific inventory type configuration
local config = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryType('lockers')

-- Get all registered inventory types
local allTypes = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryTypes()

-- Refresh items for all inventories of a specific type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:RefreshInventoryType('lockers')

-- Set new item configuration for a type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:SetInventoryTypeItems('lockers', {
    maxItems = 5,
    items = {
        { name = 'newitem', min = 1, max = 3, chance = 50 }
    }
})

-- Get current item configuration
local items = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryTypeItems('lockers')
```

#### **Runtime Features**

‚úÖ **What you can do at runtime:**
- Register new inventory types instantly
- Unregister existing types
- Update item configurations
- Refresh inventory contents
- Change loot tables
- Modify spawn chances

üîÑ **Automatic updates:**
- Existing inventories adapt to new configurations
- Client-side targets update automatically
- Object detection refreshes every 3 seconds
- Changes apply immediately without restart

#### **Behavior Configuration**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `useNetwork` | Use network ID for persistence (true) or client-side freezing (false) | `false` |

#### **Network Behavior Explained**

| Setting | Object Behavior | ID Format | Performance | Best For |
|---------|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `useNetwork = true` | Network persistent, no freezing | `type-x-y-z` coordinates | May lag with >10 items | Rare, high-value items |
| `useNetwork = false` | Client-side frozen | `type-netid` | No network overhead | Common objects, many items |

**Recommendation:** Use `useNetwork = false` for most cases unless you specifically need coordinate-based persistence.

#### **Built-in Types**

The system comes with pre-registered inventory types:

- **Dumpsters** - Automatically registered with configurable loot tables
- Support for `server.dumpsterloot` configuration or default items

#### **Best Practices**

üöÄ **Performance Optimization:**
- Default to `useNetwork = false` for better performance
- Only use `useNetwork = true` for special coordinate-based persistence
- Keep `maxItems ‚â§ 10` when using `useNetwork = true`

üîß **Development Tips:**
- All operations are runtime - test configurations live
- Use exports to modify existing types without restart
- Monitor console for performance warnings
- Objects refresh automatically every 3 seconds

üí° **Common Use Cases:**
- `useNetwork = false` ‚Üí Storage boxes, lockers, containers
- `useNetwork = true` ‚Üí Evidence lockers, weapon caches (coordinate-based)

The system includes comprehensive protection against common exploits:

**üîí Object Movement Protection:**
- **Automatic freeze** - All inventory objects are frozen on access to prevent movement
- **Real-time coordinate validation** - Continuously verifies object hasn't moved from original position
- **Movement detection** - Closes inventory if object moves more than 0.5 units
- **Entity integrity checks** - Validates entity still exists and matches original reference

**üìç Proximity Validation:**
- **Server-side coordination storage** - Object coordinates are captured and stored in the inventory
- **Client-side proximity monitoring** - Continuous distance checking every 100ms when inventory is open
- **Real-time coordinate tracking** - Uses live entity coordinates, not cached positions
- **Automatic closure** - Inventory closes with notification if player moves too far

| Security Check | Location | Frequency | Threshold |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Object Freeze | Server | On open | Immediate |
| Movement Detection | Client | 100ms | 0.5 units |
| Proximity Validation | Client | 100ms | `interaction.distance` |
| Entity Integrity | Client | 100ms | Entity existence |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Exploit Prevention:**
- Prevents object teleportation while inventory is open
- Blocks access from incorrect coordinates
- Validates entity integrity in real-time
- Automatic inventory closure on security violations


### **Registration System**

- **Runtime stash creation** from any resource
- **Custom storage locations** with coordinate-based access
- **Persistent storage** with database integration

- **Responsive layout** adapting to different screen sizes
- **Drag & drop** functionality for intuitive item management
- **Visual feedback** for all user interactions
- **Accessibility features** for better user experience
- **Container view below inventory** ‚Äì when opening item containers, their contents render in a separate grid stacked beneath the main inventory for easier organisation

- **Minimal resource usage** on client-side
- **Optimized rendering** for large inventories

---
