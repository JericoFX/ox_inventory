## üìå A Note on Community

> _A real open-source community thrives on transparency, inclusion, and mutual respect ‚Äî not on intimidation or control._

This fork is maintained with full respect for the spirit and principles of open source. I deeply appreciate the foundational work by Overextended ‚Äî all credit goes to them. However, it's important to be clear: **open-source software is not a tool for personal power, gatekeeping, or hostility**. It belongs to everyone who respects its license and contributes in good faith.

The **GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)** allows anyone to use, modify, and redistribute software ‚Äî even commercially ‚Äî as long as the same license is preserved and the original authors are credited.

Toxic behavior, cliques, or fear-based moderation are antithetical to what open source stands for. I do not support or endorse any group or individual who uses community spaces to enforce such dynamics.

Some may ask why this project isn't based directly on the original repositories. The answer is straightforward: this fork extends support and improvements for **QBCore**. I believe every developer deserves access to robust tools and respectful collaboration, no matter their choice of framework.

#### **Network Optimization**

The dynamic inventory system has been optimized with clean network ID handling:

- **Smart freeze behavior** - Objects are frozen client-side when they don't use network synchronization to prevent movement exploits
- **Network-based persistence** - Objects with network ID are inherently persistent and don't require freezing
- **Clear separation** - `useNetwork` affects both inventory ID format and object persistence behavior
- **Better performance** - Eliminated unnecessary network checks and duplicate validations

#### **Registration Process**

The dynamic inventory system is **fully runtime** - no server restart required:

```lua
-- Register a new inventory type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:RegisterInventoryType({
    name = 'lockers',
    models = { 1234567890, 9876543210 },
    interaction = {
        distance = 2.0,
        icon = 'fas fa-box',
        label = 'Open Locker'
    },
    behavior = {
        useNetwork = true  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è See performance warning below
    },
    slots = 10,
    maxWeight = 50000,
    items = {
        maxItems = 3,  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep low with useNetwork=true
        items = {
            { name = 'water', min = 1, max = 2, chance = 60 },
            { name = 'bandage', min = 1, max = 1, chance = 30 },
            { name = 'money', min = 10, max = 100, chance = 15 }
        }
    },
    validation = {
        groups = { ['police'] = 0 }  -- Optional group restrictions
    }
})
```

#### **Performance Warning**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Synchronization Alert**: When using `useNetwork = true` with `maxItems > 10`, you'll receive a warning:

```
[ox_inventory] [WARN] Inventory type "lockers" uses network synchronization with 15 max items. 
High item counts may cause network synchronization issues. Consider reducing maxItems or setting useNetwork to false.
```

**Best Practices:**
- `useNetwork = true` + `maxItems ‚â§ 10` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Good performance
- `useNetwork = false` + `maxItems > 10` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Good performance  
- `useNetwork = true` + `maxItems > 10` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause network lag

#### **Available Exports**

All operations are **runtime** - no server restart required:

```lua
-- Unregister an inventory type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:UnregisterInventoryType('lockers')

-- Get specific inventory type configuration
local config = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryType('lockers')

-- Get all registered inventory types
local allTypes = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryTypes()

-- Refresh items for all inventories of a specific type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:RefreshInventoryType('lockers')

-- Set new item configuration for a type (runtime)
exports.ox_inventory:SetInventoryTypeItems('lockers', {
    maxItems = 5,
    items = {
        { name = 'newitem', min = 1, max = 3, chance = 50 }
    }
})

-- Get current item configuration
local items = exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryTypeItems('lockers')
```

#### **Runtime Features**

‚úÖ **What you can do at runtime:**
- Register new inventory types instantly
- Unregister existing types
- Update item configurations
- Refresh inventory contents
- Change loot tables
- Modify spawn chances

üîÑ **Automatic updates:**
- Existing inventories adapt to new configurations
- Client-side targets update automatically
- Object detection refreshes every 3 seconds
- Changes apply immediately without restart

#### **Behavior Configuration**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `useNetwork` | Use network ID for persistence (true) or client-side freezing (false) | `false` |

#### **Network Behavior Explained**

| Setting | Object Behavior | ID Format | Performance | Best For |
|---------|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `useNetwork = true` | Network persistent, no freezing | `type-x-y-z` coordinates | May lag with >10 items | Rare, high-value items |
| `useNetwork = false` | Client-side frozen | `type-netid` | No network overhead | Common objects, many items |

**Recommendation:** Use `useNetwork = false` for most cases unless you specifically need coordinate-based persistence.

#### **Built-in Types**

The system comes with pre-registered inventory types:

- **Dumpsters** - Automatically registered with configurable loot tables
- Support for `server.dumpsterloot` configuration or default items

#### **Best Practices**

üöÄ **Performance Optimization:**
- Default to `useNetwork = false` for better performance
- Only use `useNetwork = true` for special coordinate-based persistence
- Keep `maxItems ‚â§ 10` when using `useNetwork = true`

üîß **Development Tips:**
- All operations are runtime - test configurations live
- Use exports to modify existing types without restart
- Monitor console for performance warnings
- Objects refresh automatically every 3 seconds

üí° **Common Use Cases:**
- `useNetwork = false` ‚Üí Storage boxes, lockers, containers
- `useNetwork = true` ‚Üí Evidence lockers, weapon caches (coordinate-based)

The system includes comprehensive protection against common exploits:

**üîí Object Movement Protection:**
- **Automatic freeze** - All inventory objects are frozen on access to prevent movement
- **Real-time coordinate validation** - Continuously verifies object hasn't moved from original position
- **Movement detection** - Closes inventory if object moves more than 0.5 units
- **Entity integrity checks** - Validates entity still exists and matches original reference

**üìç Proximity Validation:**
- **Server-side coordination storage** - Object coordinates are captured and stored in the inventory
- **Client-side proximity monitoring** - Continuous distance checking every 100ms when inventory is open
- **Real-time coordinate tracking** - Uses live entity coordinates, not cached positions
- **Automatic closure** - Inventory closes with notification if player moves too far

| Security Check | Location | Frequency | Threshold |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Object Freeze | Server | On open | Immediate |
| Movement Detection | Client | 100ms | 0.5 units |
| Proximity Validation | Client | 100ms | `interaction.distance` |
| Entity Integrity | Client | 100ms | Entity existence |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Exploit Prevention:**
- Prevents object teleportation while inventory is open
- Blocks access from incorrect coordinates
- Validates entity integrity in real-time
- Automatic inventory closure on security violations


### **Registration System**

- **Runtime stash creation** from any resource
- **Custom storage locations** with coordinate-based access
- **Persistent storage** with database integration

|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `label` | string | Display name for the preset | `presetName` |
| `items` | table | Array of items to give | Required |
| `jobs` | table | Required job names | `nil` |
| `weight_check` | boolean | Check inventory weight capacity | `false` |
| `max_uses` | number | Maximum uses per player | `nil` (unlimited) |
| `reset_on_death` | boolean | Reset usage on player death | `false` |

| `activator_distance` | number | Distance from activation location | `5.0` |

### **Item Configuration**

```lua
items = {
    {
        item = "item_name",        -- Item name (required)
        count = 1,                 -- Quantity (required)
        metadata = {               -- Optional metadata
            durability = 100,
            serial = "ABC123",
            quality = 90
        }
    }
}
```

### **Persistence System**

The presets system uses database persistence to ensure usage limits are maintained across server restarts and player disconnections:

**üîÑ How it works:**
1. **First Load** - When a player first connects, usage data is loaded from database
2. **Real-time Updates** - Every preset usage is immediately saved to database
3. **Memory + Database** - System uses memory cache for performance with database backup
4. **Automatic Cleanup** - Memory is cleared on disconnect, database persists

**üìä Database Behavior:**
- **Player Identification** - Uses framework-specific identifiers (citizenid, identifier, userId)
- **Automatic Creation** - Tables are created automatically on startup
- **Efficient Queries** - Uses UPSERT operations for optimal performance
- **Cross-Session** - Usage limits work across server restarts and reconnections

**üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity:**
- **Unique Constraints** - Prevents duplicate entries per player/preset
- **Indexed Lookups** - Fast retrieval of usage data
- **Atomic Operations** - All database updates are transactional
- **Fallback Safety** - System gracefully handles database errors

### **Best Practices**

üéØ **Performance:**
- Keep item counts reasonable (< 1000 per preset)
- Use appropriate cooldowns to prevent spam
- Monitor usage statistics for optimization
- Database operations are optimized but avoid excessive preset usage

üîê **Security:**
- Always validate permissions before applying presets
- Use job/group restrictions for sensitive items
- Monitor security logs for suspicious activity
- Implement proper cooldowns for public presets
- Database persistence prevents usage limit bypassing

‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration:**
- Test presets thoroughly before deployment
- Use descriptive labels and organize by purpose
- Document preset purposes and restrictions
- Regular cleanup of unused presets
- Database maintains historical usage data automatically

---

### **Database Tables**

The system automatically creates the following database tables:

#### **ox_preset_usage**
Stores preset usage tracking for persistent limits across sessions:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ox_preset_usage` (
    `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `player_identifier` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    `preset_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    `usage_count` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    `updated_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    UNIQUE KEY `player_preset` (`player_identifier`, `preset_name`),
    KEY `idx_player_identifier` (`player_identifier`),
    KEY `idx_preset_name` (`preset_name`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

> **Note:** Tables are created automatically on first startup. No manual database setup required.
